**Enabling Feature Manager (installer) frontend**  
Currently this feature is installed automatically. You can confirm this by typing the following text in the karaf console:

    frinx-user@root> feature:list -i | grep frinx-installer-gui 
    

If there is no output, install it manually:

    frinx-user@root> feature:install frinx-installer-gui  
    

Then open this link in a browser to access the DLUX user interface: <http://localhost:8181/index.html>

(Username admin, password admin).  
You should see a link 'Feature Manager'.

**Enabling System Manager frontend – BETA**  
This feature is in BETA release state, it is installed automatically but uses separate authentication to the Feature Manager. To install manually, type:

    frinx-user@root> feature:install frinx-config-gui 
    

Then open this link in a browser:

<http://localhost:8181/index.html#/configmgr/index>  

(Username karaf, password karaf)
