## Frinx ODL Distribution The Frinx ODL distribution is a curated and tested distribution of OpenDaylight. Each Frinx release passes thru stages of rigorous quality assurance before we make it available to our customers. We also add components and modules that make the Frinx distribution simpler to use and operate compared with other solutions on the market. Take for example the Frinx feature install agent that allows developers and operators to manage ODL features and understand dependencies with ease.
