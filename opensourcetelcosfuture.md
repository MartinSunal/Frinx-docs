### Open Source Proving Essential to Telcos' Future

While some of the hype surrounding software-centric networks has drawn cynicism, the adoption and evolution of the technology is now happening apace. The speed and sheer scope of the transformation has resulted in considerable industry upheaval, but also in increased collaboration amongst competitors, with open source a key facilitator in this.

The convergence around open source as the de facto platform for developing the networking applications of the future comes as telcos, mindful of the existential threat posed by non-traditional competitors, have concluded that speed of adaptation is a key factor in their success and even survival, and that contributions from open source communities are vital to meet ambitious virtualization targets.

As an example, AT&T plans to have virtualized at least 75% of its network by 2020. Central to this goal is its ECOMP project (enhanced control orchestration, management and policy), more than half of which it moved into open source in February under the ONAP (Open Network Automation Platform) project in the Linux Foundation; such is the scope of the work involved in meeting the above target that even after several years of development and with AT&T's R&D resources, external assistance and collaboration was deemed necessary for some areas of ONAP development. ONAP was found jointly by AT&T and China Mobile, who together have 677 million wireless subscribers.

Like AT&T, CenturyLink is making use of OpenDaylight in its drive towards virtualization. The company is using OpenDaylight software in the SDN controller in their implementation of the CORD platform (Central Office Re-architected as a Data Center). This allows it to provide a virtualized gateway to broadband DSL services using white box equipment, reducing service delivery time to customers.

FRINX itself has recently made public its collaboration with SoftBank, with which it has created an open-source based operating solution for SoftBank's networks. The full press release can be read [here][1].

FRINX makes OpenSource networking available to service providers and enterprises that want to take advantage of cutting edge innovation combined with a dependable support infrastructure. FRINX was founded in 2016 in Bratislava and consists of a team of passionate developers and industry professionals who want to change the way networking software is developed, deployed and used. FRINX offers distributions of OpenDaylight and FD.io in conjunction with support services and is proud to have service provider and enterprise customers from the Fortune Global 500 list.
