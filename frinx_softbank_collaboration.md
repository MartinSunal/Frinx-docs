### FRINX and SoftBank Collaborate to Create Open-Source Based Network Operations System

FRINX and SoftBank are collaborating and have created an open-source based operating solution for SoftBank's networks. FRINX is providing support for its distribution of OpenDaylight, enabling SoftBank to focus on creating their applications.

FRINX offers a fully supported version of OpenDaylight (FRINX ODL Distribution) that makes it a reliable infrastructure onto which SoftBank creates applications to manage their networks. Meanwhile, FRINX provides support, quality assurance and performance enhancements to the code base and manages the up-streaming process. SoftBank also uses the FRINX Smart Build Engine - a development and test environment - that allows customers to automate the build process and system tests for OpenDaylight and its applications in minutes, compared to weeks or months with Do-It-Yourself solutions.

“Open Source has become the de-facto standard for developing new applications in the networking space and SoftBank is one of the leaders in the telecommunications industry leveraging that trend.” said FRINX co-founder and CEO Gerhard Wieser. FRINX and SoftBank are moving the industry forward by building their applications on a supported open-source foundation to evolve SoftBank’s network operations.
