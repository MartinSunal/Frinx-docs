In this example we connect the controller to itself to verify that that NETCONF features were installed correctly. It is similar to loopback but done over a NETCONF session. After mounting itself, the YANG model of the Frinx ODL Distribution is exposed by RESTCONF and is an interesting point to begin exploring.

## Step 1 Install features

This can be done using the Karaf CLI:

    feature:install odl-restconf
    feature:install odl-netconf-connector-all

## Step 2 Wait until controller-config is connected

Send a GET request to mount the controller using RESTCONF

<http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/controller-config>

## Step 3 Verify that connection was successful

Examine the HTTP response -Â there should be a 200 status code and the text string

*netconf-node-inventory:connected":true*
