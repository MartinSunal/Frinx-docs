# Configuring logging level within karaf

It's possible to adjust the verbosity of logging for each FRINX ODL feature.
The following levels are available (most verbose listed first) - TRACE, DEBUG, WARN, INFO, ERROR.
INFO is less verbose and is a good compromise in terms of verbosity and effectiveness.

## Check logging level
After [starting FRINX ODL](running-frinx-odl-after-activation), first check the logging level currently set for each feature: within the karaf console type
```
log:list
```
This will display output similar to the following

```
Logger                                                           | Level
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ROOT                                                             | INFO
io.frinx                                                         | DEBUG
org.apache.karaf.features                                        | DEBUG
org.opendaylight.controller.cluster                              | DEBUG
org.opendaylight.controller.config.yang.md.sal.connector.netconf | INFO
org.opendaylight.daexim                                          | DEBUG
org.opendaylight.netconf.sal.connect                             | INFO
org.opendaylight.netconf.topology                                | INFO
```
## Add or change logging level for a particular feature
To add or change the logging level for a particular feature e.g. io.frinx.cli type

```
log:set INFO io.frinx.cli
```
You will see the logging level has been updated when you again type

```
log:list
```
The output will now be similar to the following, with the level for io.frinx.cli having been changed from DEBUG to INFO:

```
Logger                                                           | Level
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ROOT                                                             | INFO
io.frinx                                                         | DEBUG
io.frinx.cli                                                     | INFO
org.apache.karaf.features                                        | DEBUG
org.opendaylight.controller.cluster                              | DEBUG
org.opendaylight.controller.config.yang.md.sal.connector.netconf | INFO
org.opendaylight.daexim                                          | DEBUG
org.opendaylight.netconf.sal.connect                             | INFO
org.opendaylight.netconf.topology                                | INFO
```
To begin viewing the log type
```
log:tail
```
Karaf logs are also written to the data/log directory within your main FRINX ODL distribution directory so can be viewed outside of karaf.

Default settings for logging can be changed in etc/org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg
within your main FRINX ODL distribution directory.
