In this example we connect the controller to itself to verify that that NETCONF features were installed correctly. It is similar to loopback but done over a NETCONF session. After mounting itself, the YANG model of the Frinx ODL Distribution is exposed by RESTCONF and is an interesting point to begin exploring.

## Step 1 Install features
### To install for this session only
This can be done using the Karaf CLI:

    feature:install odl-restconf
    feature:install odl-netconf-connector-all

### For an install that persists in future session
To load features consistently and in accordance with our Daexim edit the **org.apache.karaf.features.cfg** file within the etc directory of your Frinx ODL distribution main directory:

By setting the **odlFeaturesBoot** variable, features will be loaded at startup, every time Frinx ODL starts:

    odlFeaturesBoot=odl-restconf,odl-netconf-connector-all

## Step 2 Wait until controller-config is connected

Send a GET request to mount the controller using RESTCONF

<http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/controller-config>

## Step 3 Verify that connection was successful

Examine the HTTP response -Â there should be a 200 status code and the text string

*netconf-node-inventory:connected":true*
