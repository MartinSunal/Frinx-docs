#### New Features, Improvements
* CLI and UNITOPO units (Device features)
    - LLDP unit added for IOS XR over CLI - Support for LLDP information retrieval from Cisco Nexus device using CLI
    - MPLS LDP management support added for Cisco IOS XR over CLI
    - VRF awareness added to BGP and OSPF management for Cisco IOS XR over CLI
    - Basic device info for Cisco IOS XR over CLI expanded - Now also returns OS type and version
within openconfig-platform/components data
    - Basic device info for Cisco IOS over CLI expanded - Now also returns OS type and version
    - Basic device info for Huawei VRP over CLI added - Provides OS type and version as well as list of installed hardware components
* Translate-unit-docs
    - Initial version of automatic documentation for cli and unitopo units added - Generated documentation can be found at https://frinxio.github.io/translation-units-docs/
    - This documentation shows the entire Openconfig data tree with added information about Readers and Writers implemented in projects cli-units and unitopo-units
* CLI topology
    - Reconnect counter added to CLI topology - Operational data in CLI topology now show number of connect attempts when unable to mount a device
    - Commit error patterns decoupled from error patterns - Error patterns checked against the output of “commit” command (or equivalent) is now in a dedicated set. No longer part of regular error patterns
    - Allow error pattern management via Datastore - Error patterns and commit error patterns can be viewed and modified even at runtime using northbound interfaces
    - Extended journaling capabilities - CLI journal can now record detailed information in addition to recording actual commands. Specifically: transaction lifecycle information and detailed information about handler invocations. This feature is by default turned off and can be used by setting parameter “journal-level” to “extended” when mounting a CLI device
    - Journal disappearance after hitting its limit was fixed, now only half of recorded data is removed once limit is hit
* Uniconfig
    - Make rollback from uniconfig optional - When an error is detected while configuring the network, uniconfig will by default rollback devices which have been successfully configured. This behavior can now be turned of using new “do-rollback” parameter of commit and checked-commit rpcs. If rollback is turned off, uniconfig will preserve partial changes to the network (except the device which failed).
* Group Based Policy
    - Include contract-ref to policy resolution process - Contract selection phase uses named-selectors from EPGs, contracts and contract-refs from local tenant where EPG is located. If named-selector matches against contract-ref then a contract is read from referenced tenant.
    - Added odl-groupbasedpolicy-noop feature - this feature does not register data change listener for tenant, so policy resolution process is not executed automatically
* Karaf
    - Make Karaf console compatible with Ubuntu 18.04 - fixed issues with command history, autocomplete, etc.

#### Known Issues
1. odl-netconf-clustered-topology:
    - Contains critical bugs and is not intended for production use, so odl-netconf-topology was modified by FRINX so that it can work in cluster. FRINX recommends using odl-netconf-topology in production environments.
2. restconf/operational/entity-owners:
    - entity-owners contains no data as entity ownership service was rewritten. Entity owners are assigned to the same node that hosts shard leaders.
3. CLI telnet connectivity with reverse telnet on Cisco devices is not supported in this release.
4. L2/3VPN service modules are supported on single node ODL.
5. Readers returning default data for non-existent instances.
    - When a specific query is issued for a child readers e.g. AreaReader in OSPF for XR, it will return default data back instead of a 404 response.
6.  Update in CLI translation units does not work properly - it invokes delete and create operations by default
