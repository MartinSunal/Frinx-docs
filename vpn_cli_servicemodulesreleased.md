### New Product Announcement - VPN & CLI Service Modules in FRINX ODL 2.3.0

FRINX is proud to release the latest version of FRINX ODL 2.3.0, including two new features that help you to automate and program your networks.

**What's new?**

FRINX has developed a VPN service module and a CLI service module to solve many real world use cases in today’s networks and that are now part of FRINX ODL.

The [VPN service module][1] enables customers to deploy VPN services in their networks by using simple REST calls to FRINX ODL instead of sending out an army of certified network engineers performing repetitive work on a myriad of heterogenous devices. We have you covered if you are using multiple device types from different vendors and we have you covered if transactions in the network have to be rolled back. We will bring your network back to a well-defined state. In the current release, we are introducing L3VPN functionality with IOS XR devices and we will add L2VPN and additional device support in our next release.

The [CLI service module][2] allows FRINX ODL to communicate with any device that has a CLI user interface. That means 100% coverage of networking devices in use today. The CLI service module enables structured and unstructured data exchange with the networking devices. Users can issue any command and receive a text string back or they can use our YANG model integration for show and config commands to send and receive structured data. Users and partners can take from and add to our device library that is made available under the Eclipse v1 open source license.

**Why should I care?**

If your network team is running short on resources to operate the network and they spend too much time maintaining shaky scripts, you will find FRINX ODL to be a new hope. If you are running proprietary network automation systems today, and you are experiencing the double pinch of high integration cost and limited resources and expertise, you will appreciate our open source networking approach.

**Who else is using this?**

Many large companies are using OpenDaylight as a network controller. AT&T together with China Mobile have created the Open Network Automation Platform (ONAP) which uses OpenDaylight under the hood 1). Centurylink shared how they used OpenDaylight to build their CORD (Central Office Re-architected as a Datacenter) infrastructure 2). FRINX is working with SoftBank as their partner for open source networking using OpenDaylight 3). There are more OpenDaylight user stories about Tencent, Comcast, China Telecom, Cornell University, Caltech LHC team, KT Corporation and many others 4).

**Isn’t OpenDaylight super complicated to use?**

We are happy to say that our mission is to make open source projects like OpenDaylight simple to use, highly available and supported, so you can focus on your job and grow and run the network. We see that open source has become the de-facto standard for new networking applications and we are committed to be a part of this thriving ecosystem.
