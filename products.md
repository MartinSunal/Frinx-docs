### Frinx ODL Distribution & Support Options

FRINX delivers an OpenDaylight distribution targeted at end-users and resellers/developers/OEM customers. The Frinx ODL distribution releases are synchronized to the ODL release schedule, offer quality assurance and include additional software only available through this distribution. Frinx offers different levels of support to address the business needs of our customers ranging from PoC stages, development periods to support requirements during critical production use of the Frinx ODL distribution. Frinx also offers training, customized consulting and development packages to bootstrap, accelerate or implement your ODL and open source based networking projects. Please see our

[services section ][1]to learn more about Frinx custom development, consulting, training and support services.

### Frinx ODL Distribution

The Frinx ODL distribution is a curated and tested distribution of OpenDaylight. Each Frinx release passes through stages of rigorous quality assurance before we make it available to our customers. We also add components and modules that make the Frinx distribution simpler to use and operate compared with other solutions on the market. For example the Frinx feature install agent allows developers and operators to manage ODL features and understand dependencies with ease. The Frinx ODL distribution comes with different license types: Our academic license provides students and academic institutions with full access to the Frinx ODL distribution at no cost. Commercial users can download and start using the Frinx ODL distribution immediately with a 30 day trial license. After 30 days, you have the option to purchase a subscription license for your installation. For questions and orders please contact our team at <a href="mailto:info@frinx.io" target="_blank">info@frinx.io</a>.

### FRINX Smart Build Engine

The FRINX Smart Build Engine (SBE) comes as a ready-to-run package for the entire software development process. It provides full integration between several well-established open-source solutions for source code management and code review, continuous integration, code quality assessment, project management and repository management.

With the SBE, a development team can immediately get the software development process underway, because all the tools have been preconfigured and linked together by FRINX.

Because it’s scalable to very large projects, it makes it much easier to take a large open source project such as OpenDaylight and fork a new version.

Please see our introductory video [here][2] For full instructions on using the SBE see our [guide][3]
