### Problem Definition:

Provision new customer L2 and L3 services in IP/MPLS and Metro networks

### Solution Summary:

Use ODL to convert customer input to device configurations via Netconf/YANG

### How is this different than xyz?

Compared to Ansible Ansible is optimal for simple configuration jobs across a medium number of networking devices. FRINX ODL can manage thousands of networking devices with high availability. FRINX ODL uses YANG service and device models instead of scripts that are hard to maintain for multiple vendor devices. Compared to Tail-f Open source solution that does not rely on the availability of a defined group of implementation partners.
