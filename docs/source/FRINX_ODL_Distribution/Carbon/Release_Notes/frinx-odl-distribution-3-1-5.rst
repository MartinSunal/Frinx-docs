frinx-odl-distribution-3-1-5
----------------------------

This document describes the latest changes, additions, known issues, and fixes for the Frinx ODL Distribution.

**Note that FRINX ODL distribution 3.1.5 requires Java 8 (Openjdk 1.8.0-171 or newer)**
To install Java:
Ubuntu: In a terminal type

.. code-block:: guess

   sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jre


CentOS: In a terminal type

.. code-block:: guess

   sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk

New Features, Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* CLI and UNITOPO units (Device features)

  * LLDP unit added for IOS XR over CLI (version 4, 5, 6) - Enables (operational) neighbor information to be pulled from an XR device
  * Initial (plaintext *execute-and-read* RPC) support for Cisco NEXUS 9k switches - Enables basic (plaintext) management of Cisco Nexus switches
  * Bugfixing

* CLI topology

  * Scaling improvements - CLI topology can now quickly and easily mount & manage thousands of devices
  * Last-fail-cause added to operational cli topology - This field shows the reason, why a connect attempt failed when mounting a device over cli e.g. no route to host

* Unified topology

  * Optimize direct-unit proxy - Do not use binding aware APIs in the direct-unit proxy. Instead directly delegate calls to southbound layer.
  * It is no longer necessary to add generated classes for new openconfig models to the direct unit.

* Uniconfig

  * Enable parallel execution in uniconfig-node-manager - In case multiple tasks are submitted to uniconfig-node-manager, it will execute them in parallel as long as they do not overlap in terms of devices accessed.
  * Number of threads to use for parallel execution can be configured in uniconfig-node-managerâ€™s blueprint file.
  * If there is no free thread to execute a task, the task will be enqueued.

* LLDP Topology app (new component)

  * New application on top of unified layer, which builds a network topology view from operational LLDP data.
  * Current support for Cisco IOS, IOS XE and IOS XR devices.
  * LLDP topology app video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN3t7toJrCs.

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. odl-netconf-clustered-topology:

   * Contains critical bugs and is not intended for production use, so odl-netconf-topology was modified by FRINX so that it can work in cluster. FRINX recommends using odl-netconf-topology in production environments.

#. restconf/operational/entity-owners:

   * entity-owners contains no data as entity ownership service was rewritten. Entity owners are assigned to the same node that hosts shard leaders.

#. CLI telnet connectivity with reverse telnet on Cisco devices is not supported in this release.
#. L2/3VPN service modules are supported on single node ODL.
#. Readers returning default data for non-existent instances.

   * When a specific query is issued for a child readers e.g. AreaReader in OSPF for XR, it will return default data back instead of a 404 response.

#. Update in CLI translation units does not work properly - it invokes delete and create operations by default
