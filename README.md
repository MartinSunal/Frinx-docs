#### Vendor Agnostic

By design the Frinx ODL Distribution is vendor agnostic. The ability to model data and to dynamically load java classes means that any protocol modellable in YANG is supportable. Example implementations of protocols include OpenFlow, PCEP and SNMP.

#### Model-driven

The Frinx ODL Distribution is model-driven, the network and operations performed on it are modeled in YANG. The YANG data structures are shared using operational and config datastores. The datastores are accessible via RESTCONF and NETCONF.
