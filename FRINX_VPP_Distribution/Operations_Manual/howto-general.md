**Dump VPP message table**

Vpp APIs work with messages, to check all the available messages and their indices use in VAT:

    dump_msg_api_table
    

**View VPP node graph**

VPP is implemented as a set of ordered graph nodes, to see them live, use following command in CLI:

    show vlib graph
    

**Trace VPP's API executions**

To record the execution of its APIs, use following command outside of VPP:

    sudo vppctl api trace save demo.api && sudo vppctl api trace custom-dump /tmp/demo.api
