### Frinx ODL Distribution

Targeted at end-users and resellers/developers/OEM customers, releases are synchronized to the ODL release schedule.

***Curated and tested*** - each release passes through stages of rigorous quality assurance before we make it available to our customers.

***FRINX components and modules*** make our distribution simpler to use and operate compared with other solutions on the market. *For example, our [CLI plugin][1] means Frinx ODL can communicate with devices even if they don't speak NETCONF or any other programmatic API.*

*We've also added automated provisioning of [L2][3] and [L3VPN][4].*

Frinx also offers ***training, customized consulting and development*** packages to bootstrap, accelerate or implement your ODL and open source based networking projects.
